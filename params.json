Toolpaths are all setup for a 1/8\" end mill. Use plywood or HDPE that is exactly 1/2\" thick for this.\r\n\r\nIf you want to 3D print it, 10% infill, 2 shells, .2mm layer height at 215 degrees using PLA on a Makerbot worked very well. No need for raft or supports.\r\n\r\nI've also included a Sketchup model if you want to modify the pointer. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
