Handibot-Pointer
================

This is a 3D printable or millable replacement pointer for your Handibot

You can print this on a 3D printer, or better you can mill it on your Handibot.

For milling, see the attached VCarve file. Toolpaths are all setup for a 1/8" end mill. Use plywood or HDPE that is exactly 1/2" thick for this.

If you want to 3D print it, 10% infill, 2 shells, .2mm layer height at 215 degrees using PLA on a Makerbot worked very well. No need for raft or supports.

I've also included a Sketchup model if you want to modify the pointer.
